While at the party, Homer is invited to dance on stage with a stripper. Bart (who is dining with the rest of the family in the next-door restaurant) uses his camera to snap a photo of Homer and the dancer having a great time. At school, Martin develops the picture, which - after he compliments Bart's work - gets distributed around school, and eventually around town. Marge sees the photo and is outraged. Homer arrives home, where Marge immediately confronts her husband and kicks him out of the house. Eventually, Marge agrees to let him back in on the condition he take Bart around to meet the stripper and show that she is not a sex object. After almost winding up on stage at another of the dancer's performances, Homer does as he is asked and all is forgiven.",

Bart is convinced that he is innocent, with Lisa's help, eventually deduces that someone was trying to frame him. Tying information together from news reports, their own knowledge and logical reasoning, Bart and Lisa expose Krusty's sidekick, Sideshow Bob as the culprit. Bob, it seems, had grown weary of being the butt of Krusty's physical gags and being part of an inane show, and with Krusty out of the way he could reshape the show into his more scholastic vision. Bob is arrested and swears revenge, while Krusty is freed.",

Homer encourages Bart to donate, anticipating getting a big reward from Burns in exchange for saving his life. When Bart gives his blood and no reward comes (only a thank-you card), Homer gets angry and writes a nasty letter to Burns. Marge intervenes and talks Homer out of mailing the letter. However, Bart, not perceiving that Homer had second thoughts, discovers and mails the letter. Chaos ensues as Homer and Bart try to retrieve the letter before Burns receives it.",

      "plot": "After attending a Spinal Tap rock concert, Bart becomes inspired to become a heavy metal guitarist. When he finds he is (at best) marginally talented, he seeks advice from Otto. Otto decides to demonstrate his guitar skills, but forgets that he needs to take his busload of students to school. In the ensuing chaos, he drives recklessly and causes a rollover accident in front of the school. Although nobody is hurt, Principal Skinner finds out that Otto is unlicensed and fires him; Skinner takes over the job, but is a little too overcautious (unlike his predecessor). Meanwhile, the now jobless Otto is soon evicted from his apartment and forced to move in with the Simpsons. Otto just wants to lay around the house and play guitar, which irritates Homer, but Otto's attitude gets worse when he is unable to pass his driver's exam, despite several tries. When Homer confronts Otto about his laziness, Otto declares that he plans to staple his new license to Homer's head once he passes the test ....",

She urges Homer and Marge to be more strict with Bart when it comes to discipline. They try out Krabappel's advice when Bart damages Grampa's dentures in his latest household antics and ground him from supper. Bart realizes he needs to change, but when Homer comes into his room with pizza, he decides he can get away with anything. However, Bart eventually presses his luck. One day when he is asked to watch Maggie, she wanders off and knocks the car in gear, crashing it into Springfield Prison (resulting in a massive jailbreak). This time, Homer decides he needs to be severe with Bart: He can never watch the soon-to-open \"The Itchy and Scratchy Movie,\" a movie that has seen a massive advertising blitz in Springfield. Bart forlornly watches a long line for the movie extend past his house, and as the months pass, he finally realizes he needs to change. Homer tells him...",

Things are blown way out of proportion when Ashley interprets Homer's innocent actions as a sexual advance, prompting her to mount a huge anti-harassment campaign against Homer. Several attempts to exonerate himself - most notably, a totally inaccurate segment on the tabloid TV show \"Rock Bottom\" - only make things worse. As the media coverage intensifies, his friends turn against him and his name becomes comedy fodder, Homer becomes resigned to his tarnished reputation. Finally, after Lisa produces a segment for a cable-access TV show (where Homer defends himself), Groundskeeper Willie finally produces evidence to exonerate the Simpson patriarch.",

When the authorities are unable to find Bob, they decide to err on the side of safety and give into his demands. However, Krusty the Clown uses an emergency transmitter to begin broadcasting from a civil defense shed. Bob is angered and detonates the bomb, which turns out to be a dud. With both moves having failed, Bob kidnaps Bart and steals a Wright Brothers-era plane to crash into the civil defense shed where Krusty is holed up inside. However, the antique plane is mechanically unable to carry out its intended suicide mission, and once the plane stalls, Bob is easily arrested.",

In the Town Hall, after the Mayor's meeting about the change, Homer discovers that all the rich people live on one side of Springfield, with the old code, and Homer is left to try and manage with the new code. However, he protests, and ends up splitting Springfield into Old and New. Homer desperately tries different ways to tackle Old Springfield, but in doing so, he only makes them richer when they discover gold at the bottom of the river. Homer finally builds a large wall to separate the two sides, and remembers that The Who are planned to stage at Springfield for a concert. Will Homer manage to convince The Who to play on his side of town instead of the other's?",

This helps with the father-daughter relationship, as Homer knows what she would want to do. However, the detective, Dexter Colt, has charged him $1000, and few of the charges relate to his work (namely, a $40 steak, super-unleaded fuel and silver bullets [the idiot thought Lisa was a werewolf]). Homer, of course, refuses to pay the bill, so Colt breaks into the animal testing lab, and as Lisa is against animal testing, and some of Lisa's belongings are there, the police assume it was her who did it. Can Homer expose Colt and exonerate Lisa before she's jailed?",

Convinced that there is no such thing as having too many clubs or activities listed on her resume, Lisa jumps at the opportunity to coach Bart's little league team. Despite having little understanding of baseball, Lisa coaches the team to a record winning streak by putting her book smarts in statistics and probability into play. But when Bart questions Lisa's coaching tactics and confronts her for taking the fun out of baseball, Lisa benches him from the championship game. Hoping to lift his spirits, Marge spends the day with Bart at an amusement park where MLB manager and former catcher Mike Scioscia gives Bart sound advice and reminds him of his genuine love of the sport. Meanwhile, with one last chance to win the game, Lisa makes an unexpected call and learns that there is more to sports than winning.",

While Homer is on tour, Marge attempts to help the neighborhood cat lady and change her hoarder ways, but turns into a hoarder herself in the process, and Homer realizes that life on the road is not all high times and slapstick humor.",
